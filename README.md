EggDrop is a PokemonGo meets Instagram. It’s a mobile, location-based, geocaching web application for users to share pictures and messages in the form of a scavenger hunt. 

###What is an Egg? 

An egg consists of a picture and image of the user’s choice. 

To ‘drop’ an egg is to pin that picture and image to the map in the form of a marker - fixing it to that location’s coordinates. 

The conceit of EggDrop is that users can only ‘claim’ an egg and view its contents if they’re within 300feet of the drop location.
