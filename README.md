EggDrop is a PokemonGo meets Instagram. It’s a mobile, location-based, geocaching web application for users to share pictures and messages in the form of a scavenger hunt. 

### What is an Egg? 

An egg consists of a picture and image of the user’s choice. 

To ‘drop’ an egg is to pin that picture and image to the map in the form of a marker - fixing it to that location’s coordinates. 

The conceit of EggDrop is that users can only ‘claim’ an egg and view its contents if they’re within 300feet of the drop location. 

## Features:

1. User can create a password protected account. 
2. User can send a follow request to another user. 
3. User can accept or reject follow request. 
4. User can live search for another user. 
5. User can upload a file and text-based message. 
6. User can 'pin' that file and text message to the map in the form of an egg. 
7. User can view the distance between themselves and an egg. 
8. User can claim an egg if they're within 300 feet of that egg. 
9. User can view all their claimed eggs in their profile, along with their followers and following. 
10. User can view notifications when another user claims their egg or requests to follow.
11. User can create three types of eggs: 
    - Public Eggs (claimable by anyone)
    - Followers Only Eggs (claimable by followers)
    - Private Eggs (claimable by only one of their chosen followers)
